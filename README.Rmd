The goal of `codeusage` is to make yearly summaries of **SNOMED Code Usage in Primary Care** and **ICD-10 and OPCS-4 Code Usage in Secondary Care** in England, published by NHS Digital, available in R for research.
The interactive [Code Usage Explorer](https://milanwiedemann.shinyapps.io/codeusage/) dashboard provides different options to explore these datasets.  
The original data is available from NHS Digital at:

-   [SNOMED Code Usage in Primary Care](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mi-snomed-code-usage-in-primary-care)
-   [ICD-10 and OPCS-4 Code Usage in Secondary Care](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/hospital-admitted-patient-care-activity)

## Installation

You can install the development version of `codeusage` like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("ebmdatalab/codeusage")
```

## Example

```{r load-pkg}
# Load codeusage package
library(codeusage)
```

### Dataset: SNOMED Code Usage in Primary Care in England
