The goal of `opencodecounts` is to make yearly summaries of **SNOMED Code Usage in Primary Care** and **ICD-10 and OPCS-4 Code Usage in Secondary Care** in England, published by the NHS, available in R for research.
The interactive [opencodecounts Shiny App](https://bennettoxford.github.io/opencodecounts/articles/app.html) provides different options to explore these datasets.  
The original data is available from NHS Digital at:

-   [SNOMED Code Usage in Primary Care](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mi-snomed-code-usage-in-primary-care)
-   [ICD-10 and OPCS-4 Code Usage in Inpatient Secondary Care](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/hospital-admitted-patient-care-activity)
